PORTFOLIO DESIGNING WEBSITE FOR PHOTOGRAPHERS

A portfolio website is a unique way to showcase one’s work and let others know about them. It’s like an evergreen platform for one’s projects, case studies, and information. In addition, it’s one of the best ways to express one’s personality, experience, and capabilities.

A portfolio is a great way for photographers, designers, developers and a wide range of artists to present their work online. It lets them reflect their identity through their works – photos, graphic design, sketches, etc.

In order to provide many of these services together to photographers with non-technical background, the web application was purpose-built using the well-documented PHP and MySQL database in conjunction with the templating system HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (programming language).
